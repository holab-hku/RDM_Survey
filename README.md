# RDM_Survey

This repository contains the R script that was used in the analysis of questionnaire survey results about research data management practices and challenges at the University of Hong Kong.

When the R script is run, figure images which align with the Elsevier Policies on Artwork and media instructions will be generated and exported into a 'Figures' folder at the working root directory of R. A folder named 'Figures' will be automatically created if it is not present in the directory. Please be aware that any existing image files in the 'Figures' folder with the filenames 'Figure1.tiff', 'Figure2.tiff', 'Figure3.tiff', or 'Figure4.tiff' will be overwritten by the R script's outputs.
